Arduino Libraries Required for UNO+WiFi R3:

1. LiquidCrystal_I2C
   - Install via Arduino Library Manager
   - Search for "LiquidCrystal I2C" by Frank de Brabander
   - Required for LCD1602 I2C display

2. ArduinoJson
   - Install via Arduino Library Manager  
   - Search for "ArduinoJson" by Benoit Blanchon
   - Required for parsing API responses
   - UNO+WiFi R3 has 2KB SRAM, so we use 1024 byte documents

3. ESP8266 Board Package
   - Install via Arduino Library Manager
   - Search for "ESP8266 by ESP8266 Community"
   - Install version 2.1.0 (latest stable)
   - Required for ESP8266 WiFi module support

4. Wire (built into Arduino IDE)
   - No installation needed
   - Used for I2C communication

Installation Instructions:
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to File > Preferences
3. Add to "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
   ```
   http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
   ```
4. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
5. Install ESP8266 board package
6. Install LiquidCrystal_I2C and ArduinoJson libraries
